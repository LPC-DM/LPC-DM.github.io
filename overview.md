title: Overview & Projects 
---
<p>The LPC-DM group is based at the Fermilab <a href="http://lpc.fnal.gov/"> LHC Physics Center</a>. Most of its members are current or previous LPC Fellows, funded through one of the multiple LPC programs (LPC Distingushed Researcher, LPC Graduate Scholars, LPC Guest & Visitor)</p>

The group is currently focusing on two different sub-group activities:
<ul>
          <li><strong>MET+X</strong></li>
	  <p>Searches involving dark matter particles produced in associacion with jets or a resonance, with special interest in the hadronic decays of the latter.</p>
	  <p>In this kind of searces tipically dark matter manifests itself as a large imbalance in the transverse momentum, making this physics observable the kinematic quantity used to perform the measurement.</p>
          <li><strong>LLP</strong></li>
	  <p>Searches involving the production of long-lived particles</p>
	  <p>This kind of searches are particularly challenging since they look at unorthodox final states populated by non-standard physics objects, like the ones generated by the production of exotic particles with long lifetimes.</p>
	  <p> Displaced lepton-jets are a possible manifestation of such particles, and their production can be directly or indirectly theoretically connected to the existence of dark matter.</p>
</ul>
All these activities are performed within the <a href="https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/PhysicsResultsEXO"> CMS Exotica Group</a>.
